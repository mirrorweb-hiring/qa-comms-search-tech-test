## Improvement suggestion for better UX / accessibility

1. Loading Indicator on Sign-In: Implement a loading indicator after the user clicks the sign-in button to prevent accidental double-clicks.

2. Search Result Summary: Display the total number of search results with a summary, such as "10 results found for 'te'."

3. Meaningful Placeholder: Use a more descriptive placeholder in the search field, like "Enter email ID."

4. Clickable Recent Messages: Make rows in the "Most Recent Messages" section on the dashboard clickable to allow for quick access to detailed views.

5. Recent Messages Status Indicators: Add visual indicators to recent messages on the dashboard to show their status (e.g., read, unread, important).

6. Password Show/Hide Option: Include a show/hide option for the password field on the login screen to improve user experience.

7. Remember Me Option on Sign-In: Provide a "Remember Me" option to allow users to stay signed in for future sessions, if applicable.

8. Caps Lock Indicator on sign-in : Include a caps lock indicator on the login screen to help for better user experience.

9. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA, such as SMS codes or email verification, to enhance security.

10. Social Media Login: Offer login options via social media accounts like Google or Facebook to improve user experience, if applicable.

11. Pagination on Search Results: Add pagination to the search results page to reduce excessive scrolling and prevent overwhelming users with too much information.

12. Clear/Reset Button: Include a clear or reset button in the search area to allow users to start a new search easily.

13. Search Button Validation: Implement validation or disable the search button until a search term is entered.

14. Simplify Search Field Area: Simplify the search field area by removing unnecessary text. For example, instead of displaying "Enter a search query to find messages that match your criteria" separately, show this as a validation message if the user tries to search without input.

15. Application Name in Sign-In Prompt: Include the application name in the sign-in prompt, such as "Sign in to your Comms Search account," for a better user experience.

16. Timezone Stamps on Recent Messages: Add timezone stamps to the most recent messages to improve readability.

17. Rounding Percentages on Dashboard: Round off percentage calculations on the dashboard for better clarity.

18. Display Profile Info/Settings: Display profile information or settings on the Dashboard/Home page for easier access.

19. Forgot/Reset Password Option on sign-in: Add a "Forgot/Reset Password" option on the login screen to improve accessibility.
