# QA Comms Search Tech Test

## 🎛️ Overview

Welcome to the MirrorWeb Tech Test! We'd like to see how you approach building out testing solutions for a project as well as identifying existing issues with an application.

This repository contains a basic application for searching through a database of messages (not unlike MirrorWeb's Insight platform!), made up of a [Remix](https://remix.run/) frontend and a [Hono](https://hono.dev/) API. It's in the early prototyping stages, but it has some of the core functionality in place already (e.g. authentication, basic stats dashboard, searching for messages etc). However, there is a distinct lack of testing and just a few issues...

## 🔨 Tasks

We'd like you to review the functionality of the application, identify any issues or areas you would suggest could be improved and implement an end to end testing solution with a framework of your choice. 


> 🚨 **Attention!** As it's still in the early stages, this app also still has some pesky bugs hanging around related to UX, accessibility, and some nasty security vulnerabilities. If you have some ideas that would need more time to implement, please document what you've done or note them down as these can be good to discuss in your interview!

## Getting started

Install:

```bash
npm install
```

Setup (you will see your login credentials logged in your console when this command finishes running):

```bash
npm run setup
```

Run the API and UI together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` and you should see the login page!


## Submitting your work

To complete the tech test you will need to clone down this GitHub repo, create a feature branch from main and do all of your work from this branch, create a single PR with all your changes back into main. When you’re ready, share your submission back with us, ideally via a private Github repository with the PR open so we can schedule it for review. We review submissions as quickly as possible. You’ll hear back from us no matter what.

Remember, we are not timing you and there is no deadline. Work at your own pace. Reach out if you're stuck or have any questions. We want you to succeed and are here to help! We won't give you much in the way of hints, but we can at least help you orient yourself about the challenge!
